\subsubsection{Consistency}
\begin{theorem}At any time and for any two correct learners $l_i$ and $l_j$, $learned_{l_i}$ and $learned_{l_j}$ can subsequently be extended to equivalent sequences \par
\end{theorem} 
\textbf{Proof:} \par

\indent\indent\parbox{\linewidth-\algorithmicindent*2}{\strut\textbf{Proof:} }\par
\indent\indent\indent\parbox{\linewidth-\algorithmicindent*3}{\strut1.1. At any given instant, $\forall seq,seq' \in \mathcal{P}, \forall l_i,l_j \in \mathcal{L}, learned(l_i,seq) \land learned(l_j,seq') \implies \exists \sigma_1, \sigma_2 \in \mathcal{P}, \forall x \in \mathcal{P}, (acc\_send(N-s, seq) \lor (acc\_send(N-u, seq) \land wait\_learn(3T,l_i,seq)) \lor (min\_accepted(seq) \land (seq \thicksim x \bullet \sigma_1 \lor x \thicksim seq \bullet \sigma_1))) \land (acc\_send(N-s, seq') \lor (acc\_send(N-u, seq') \land wait\_learn(3T,l_j,seq')) \lor (min\_accepted(seq') \land (seq' \thicksim x \bullet \sigma_2 \lor x \thicksim seq' \bullet \sigma_2)))$} \par
\indent\indent\indent\indent\parbox{\linewidth-\algorithmicindent*4}{\strut\textbf{Proof:} A sequence can be learned if: (1) the learner gathers either $N-s$ votes (Algorithm \ref{VFT-Learn} lines \{1-4\}), (2) the learner gathers $N-u$ votes after a timeout of $3T$ occurs (Algorithm \ref{VFT-Learn} \{5, 10-13\}) or (3) if the sequence is universally commutative  and the learner gathers $f+1$ votes (Algorithm \ref{VFT-Learn} \{7-8\}). This requires that the sequence must be commutative with any other possible sequence, which is encoded in the logical expression $s \thicksim x \bullet \sigma \lor x \thicksim \bullet \sigma$. This expression is true if either the learned sequence $s$ can be extended with some suffix $\sigma_1$ to any other sequence $x$ or if any sequence $x$ can be extended with some prefix $\sigma_2$ to be equivalent to $s$.}

\indent\indent\indent\indent\indent\indent\parbox{\linewidth-\algorithmicindent*6}{\strut\textbf{Proof:} To prove that if any two sequences are accepted then they must be extensible to equivalent sequences, we must prove that two non-commutative sequences can't both gather a quorum of votes. Since a correct acceptor will not vote for two non-commutative sequences, we must prove that in, any two gathered quorums, the intersection between them contains at least one correct quorum.\par
Gathered quorums can be of size $Q_1=N-s$ or $N-u \leq Q_2 < N-s$, which means there are three possible combinations: (1) two quorums of size $Q_1$, (2) two quorums of size $Q_2$ and (3) one quorum of size $Q_1$ and one quorum of size $Q_2$.\par
To guarantee that two quorums of size $Q_1$ intersect in at least one correct process, it must hold that $N-s+N-s > N+o$. Assuming the worst case scenario where $N=u+o+s+1$:
\begin{align*}
	N-s+N-s > N+o \\
	N-2s > o \\
	u+o+s+1-2s > o \\
	u+1-s>0 \\
	u+1>s 
\end{align*} 
Since we already assume that $u<s$, the condition holds.\par
Given two quorums of size $Q_2$, when the first quorum is gathered the sizes are $q_1= N-u-a$ and $q_2=N-u-b$. This means that there are $u-a-s$ crashed processes and the system size is now $N'=N-u+a+s$. To guarantee that the intersection between the quorums contains at least one correct process, the following must hold $q_1+q_2-N'>o$. 
\begin{align*}
	q_1+q_2-N'>o \\
	N-u+a+N-u+b-N+u-a-s>o \\
	N-u+b-s>o \\
	u+o+s+1-u+b-s>o\\
	b+1>0
\end{align*}
Given a quorum of size $Q_1=N-s$ and a quorum of size $Q_2=N-u+a$, at least $u-a-s$ processes have crashed, which means that the system is now of size $N'=N-u+a+s$. To guarantee that the intersection between quorums contains at least one correct process, the following must hold $Q_1+Q_2-N'>o$:
\begin{align*}
	Q_1+Q_2-N'>o \\
	N-s+N-u+a-N+u-a-s>o\\
	N-2s>o\\
	u+o+s+1-2s>o\\
	u-s+1>0
\end{align*}
Since we already assume that $u>s$, the condition holds.}

\subsubsection{Non-Triviality}
\begin{theorem}
If all proposers are correct, $learned_l$ can only contain proposed commands \label{N-T1} \par

\indent\indent\parbox{\linewidth}{\strut\textbf{Proof:} By Algorithm \ref{VFT-Acc} lines \{31-44\} and Algorithm \ref{VFT-Learn} lines \{1-8\}, if a correct learner learned a sequence $s$ at any given instant then either a quorum was gathered or $f+1$ (if $seq$ is universally commutative) acceptors must have executed phase $2b$ for $seq$.}\par
\parbox{\linewidth}{\strut2. At any given instant, $\forall seq,x \in \mathcal{P}, \exists \sigma \in \mathcal{P}, acc\_send(N-s, seq) \lor (acc\_send(N-u, seq) \land wait\_learn(3T,l_i,seq)) \lor (min\_accepted(seq) \land (seq \thicksim x \bullet \sigma \lor x \thicksim seq \bullet \sigma)) \implies proposed(seq)$ }\par
\indent\indent\parbox{\linewidth}{\strut\textbf{Proof:} By Algorithm \ref{VFT-Acc} lines \{9-11, 17-19\}, for either a quorum to be gathered or $f+1$ acceptors to accept a proposal, it must have been proposed by a proposer.}\par

\subsubsection{Stability}
\begin{theorem}
If $learned_l = seq$ then, at all later times, $seq \sqsubseteq learned_l$, for any sequence $seq$ and correct learner $l$ \par \label{S-T1}
\end{theorem} 
\textbf{Proof:} By Algorithm \ref{VFT-Learn} lines \{8,18\}, a correct learner can only append new commands to its $learned$ command sequence.

\subsubsection{Liveness}
\begin{theorem}
For any correct learner $l$ and any proposal $seq$ from a correct proposer, eventually $learned_l$ contains $seq$ \label{L-T1} \par
\end{theorem}

\indent\indent\parbox{\linewidth}{\strut\textbf{Proof:} A proposed sequence is either conflict-free when it's incorporated into every acceptor's current sequence or it creates conflicting sequences at different acceptors. In the first case, it's accepted by a quorum (Algorithm \ref{VFT-Acc} lines \{27-31\}) and learned after the votes reach the learners. In the second case, eventually the next ballot is initiated and the sequence is sent in phase $1b$ messages to the leader (Algorithm \ref{VFT-Acc} lines \{24-29\}). After being sent to the leader, the sequence is incorporated in the next proposal and sent to the acceptors a long with others proposed commands (Algorithm \ref{VFT-Lead} lines \{23-27,29-35\}).} \par
