\begin{definition}
(Multi-valued wait-free consensus with adversary $\mathcal{A}$)

A process is \emph{correct} with respect to crash adversary 
in an execution $E$ if it takes infinitely many steps in $E$.
%
\begin{itemize}
\item (Agreement): No two processes agree on different values  
\item (Liveness): Every correct process (w.r.t $\mathcal{A}$) 
eventually decides on a value previously proposed by a correct process (w.r.t $\mathcal{A}$).
\end{itemize}
