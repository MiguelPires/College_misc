This is a more polished version of the manuscript that authors published earlier at SSS. The authorspre sent an overview of the Generalized version of Paxos, and the extend it with a simplified Byzantine fault model. 

However, I had hard time to follow all listed algorithms. The manuscript lacks references and descriptions  to mostof them. Thus I had to imagine myself the point of each algorithm. Also some of the existing references to algorithms appear a few pages after the location of the algorithm.

So as a suggestion to authors:

-Please add references and explanations to all algorithms that you mention. 
Apart from some references to specific lines of a few of the algorithms

(e.g. Algorithm 3 lines {32-33}),
most of them take some time to figure out what they do and why they are in the paper.
