### What is this?

This repo is a collection of some of my old college projects. They're not very well written or documented but, mostly due to nostalgia, I didn't want to delete them. I'm collecting them here, in order to clear my page of non-active and undocumented projects.

These projects are mostly about distributed systems and algorithms but, there are also some AI and metaprogramming ones. Most of them are written in Java or C, with a few others being written in C++, C# and other languages. I also added some Tex repos, with journal submissions and dissertation related work.
