%\subsection{Description}\\

This section presents our Byzantine fault tolerant Generalized Paxos
Protocol (or BGP, for short). Given our space constraints, we opted
for merging in a single description a novel presentation of
Generalized Paxos and its extension to the Byzantine model, even though
each represents an independent contribution in its own right.

\subsection{Overview}
We modularize our protocol explanation according to the following main components, which are also present in other protocols of the Paxos family:

\begin{itemize}

\item
  {\bf View-change} -- The goal of this subprotocol is to ensure that, at any given moment, one of the proposers is chosen as a distinguished leader, who runs a specific version of the agreement subprotocol. To achieve this, the view-change subprotocol continuously replaces leaders, until one is found that can ensure progress (i.e., commands are eventually appended to the current sequence).

\item
{\bf Agreement} -- Given a fixed leader, this subprotocol extends the current sequence with a new command or set of commands. Analogously to Fast Paxos~\cite{L06} and Generalized Paxos~\cite{Lamport2005}, choosing this extension can be done through two variants of the protocol: using either {\bf classic ballots} or {\bf fast ballots}, with the characteristic that fast ballots complete in fewer communication steps, but may have to fall back to using a classic ballot when there is contention among concurrent requests.

\end{itemize}

\subsection{View-change} 

The goal of the view-change subprotocol is to elect a distinguished acceptor process, called the leader, that carries through the agreement protocol, i.e., enables proposed commands to eventually be learned by all the learners. The overall design of this subprotocol is similar to the corresponding part of existing BFT state machine replication protocols~\cite{CL99}.\par
In this subprotocol, the system moves through sequentially numbered views, and the leader for each view is chosen in a rotating fashion using the simple equation $\textit{leader(view)}=\textit{view mod N}$. The protocol works continuously by having acceptor processes monitor whether progress is being made on adding commands to the current sequence, and, if not, they multicast a signed {\sc suspicion} message for the current view to all acceptors suspecting the current leader. Then, if enough suspicions are collected, processes can move to the subsequent view. 
However, the required number of suspicions must be chosen in a way that prevents Byzantine processes from triggering view changes spuriously. 
To this end, acceptor processes will multicast a view-change message indicating their commitment to starting a new view only after hearing that $f+1$ processes 
suspect the leader to be faulty. This message contains the new view number, the $f+1$ signed suspicions, and is signed by the acceptor that sends it. In the pseudocode, signatures are created by signing data with a process' private key (e.g., $data_{priv_p}$) and validated by decrypting the data with its public key (e.g., $data_{pub_p}$).
This way, if a process receives a view-change message without previously receiving $f+1$ suspicions, 
it can also multicast a view-change message, after verifying that the suspicions are correctly signed by $f+1$ distinct processes.
%As such, the signatures allow a process that receives this message to commit to the new view and multicast its own view-change message without receiving $f+1$ suspicions itself.
This guarantees that if one correct process receives the $f+1$ suspicions and multicasts the view-change message, then all correct processes, upon receiving this message, will be able to validate the proof of $f+1$ suspicions and also multicast the view-change message.\par

\vspace*{-.4cm}
Finally, an acceptor process must wait for $N-f$ view-change messages to start participating in the new view, i.e., update its view number and the corresponding leader process. At this point, the acceptor also assembles the $N-f$ view-change messages proving that others are committing to the new view, and sends them to the new leader. This allows the new leader to start its leadership role in the new view once it validates the $N-f$ signatures contained in a single message.

\subsection{Agreement protocol} 

The consensus protocol allows learner processes to agree on equivalent sequences of commands (according to our previous definition of equivalence).
An important conceptual distinction between the original Paxos protocol and BGP is that, in the original Paxos, each instance of consensus is called a ballot, whereas in BGP, instead of being a separate instance of consensus, 
ballots correspond to an extension to the sequence of learned commands of a single ongoing consensus instance. Proposers can try to extend the current sequence by either single commands or sequences of commands. We use the term \textit{proposal} to denote either the command or sequence of commands that was proposed.

As mentioned, ballots can either be \textit{classic} or \textit{fast}. In classic ballots, a leader proposes a single proposal to be appended to the commands learned by the learners. The protocol is then similar to the one used by classic Paxos~\cite{Lam98}, with a first phase where each acceptor conveys to the leader the sequences that the acceptor has already voted for (so that the leader can resend commands that may not have gathered enough votes), followed by a second phase where the leader instructs and gathers support for appending the new proposal to the current sequence of learned commands. Fast ballots, in turn, allow any proposer to attempt to contact all acceptors in order to extend the current sequence within only two message delays (in case there are no conflicts between concurrent proposals). However, both types of ballots contain an additional round between the proposal phase and the voting phase called the verification phase. This additional round is an all-to-all broadcast between acceptors in which acceptors broadcast proofs indicating their committal to a sequence.

Next, we present the protocol for each type of ballot in detail. We start by describing fast ballots since their structure has consequences that implicate classic ballots.
	\vspace*{-.4cm}
\subsection{Fast ballots} 

In contrast to classic ballots, fast ballots leverage the weaker specification of generalized consensus (compared to classic consensus) in terms of command ordering at different replicas, to allow for the faster execution of commands in some cases.\par
The basic idea of fast ballots is that proposers contact the acceptors directly, bypassing the leader, and then the acceptors send their vote for the current sequence directly to the learners, where this sequence now incorporates the proposed value. If a conflict exists and progress isn't being made, the protocol reverts to using a classic ballot. This is where generalized consensus allows for avoiding falling back to this slow path, namely in the case where the commands that are sequenced in a different order at different acceptors commute. However, this concurrency introduces safety problems even when a quorum is reached for some sequence due to the possibility of votes being delayed before reaching the learners. This situation coupled with the wrong proposal being sent in phase $2a$, could result in different sequences being learned by different learners. This is prevented by the introduction of a verification phase where acceptors gather proof of vote for $N-f$ acceptors such that they're able to send these proofs to the leader in the next classic ballot.

\iffalse If we keep the previous Fast Paxos message pattern, it's possible for one sequence $s$ to be learned at one learner $l_1$ while another non-commutative sequence $s'$ is learned before $s$ at another learner $l_2$. Suppose $s$ obtains a quorum of votes and is learned by $l_1$ but the same votes are delayed indefinitely before reaching $l_2$. In the next classic ballot, when the leader gathers a quorum of phase $1b$ messages it must arbitrate an order for the commands that it received from the acceptors and it doesn't know the order in which they were learned. This is because, of the $N-f$ messages it received, $f$ may not have participated in the quorum and other $f$ may be Byzantine and lie about their vote, which only leaves one correct acceptor that participated in the quorum. A single vote isn't enough to determine if the sequence was learned or not. If the leader picks the wrong sequence, it would be proposing a sequence $s'$ that is non-commutative to a learned sequence $s$. Since the learning of $s$ was delayed before reaching $l_2$, $l_2$ would learn $s'$ and be in a conflicting state with respect to $l_1$, violating consistency. In order to prevent this, sequences accepted by a quorum of acceptors must be monotonic extensions of previous accepted sequences. Regardless of the order in which a learner learns a set of monotonic sequences, the resulting state will be the same. The additional verification phase is what allows acceptors to prove to the leader that some sequence was accepted by a quorum. By gathering $N-f$ proofs for some sequence, an acceptor can prove that at least $f+1$ correct acceptors voted for that sequence. Since there are only another $2f$ acceptors in the system, no other non-commutative values can be voted for by a quorum. An interesting alternative to requiring $N-f$ proofs from each acceptor, would be for the leader to wait for $2f+1$ phase $1b$ messages for some sequence. Since at least $f+1$ of those would be correct, only that sequence could've been learned since any other non-commutative sequence would obtain at most $2f$ votes. Zyzzyva uses a similar approach of waiting for $3f+1$ to commit requests in single round-trip in executions where no faults occur~\cite{Kotla:2008}. However, this approach is unsuitable for BGP since it's possible for a sequence to be chosen by a majority without the leader being aware of more than $f+1$ votes in its quorum. Since $f+1$ votes aren't enough to ensure the leader that the sequence was chosen by a majority, the leader wouldn't be able to pick a learned sequence.\par
\fi
Next, we explain each of the protocol's steps for fast ballots in greater detail.

\noindent {\bf Step 1: Proposer to acceptors.}
To initiate a fast ballot, the leader informs both proposers and acceptors that the proposals may be sent directly to the acceptors. Unlike classic ballots, where the sequence proposed by the leader consists of the commands received from the proposers appended to previously proposed commands, in a fast ballot, proposals can be sent to the acceptors in the form of either a single command or a sequence to be appended to the command history. These proposals are sent directly from the proposers to the acceptors.\par

\noindent {\bf Step 2: Acceptors to acceptors.}
Acceptors append the proposals they receive to the proposals they have previously accepted in the current ballot and broadcast the result to the other acceptors. This broadcast contains a signed tuple of the current ballot and the sequence being voted for and intuitively corresponds to a verification phase where acceptors gather proof that a sequence gathered enough support to be committed. This proof will be sent to the leader in subsequent ballots in order for it to pick a new sequence that preserves consistency. To ensure safety, correct learners must learn non-commutative commands in a total order. When an acceptor gathers $N-f$ proofs for equivalent values, it proceeds to the next phase. That is, sequences do not necessarily have to be equal in order to be learned since commutative commands may be reordered. Recall that a sequence is equivalent to another if it can be transformed into the second one by reordering its elements without changing the order of any pair of non-commutative commands. (Note that, in the pseudocode, proofs for equivalent sequences are being treated as belonging to the same index of the \emph{proofs} variable, to simplify the presentation.) By requiring $N-f$ votes for a sequence of commands, we ensure that, given two sequences where non-commutative commands are differently ordered, only one sequence will receive enough votes even if $f$ Byzantine acceptors vote for both sequences. Outside the set of (up to) $f$ Byzantine acceptors, the remaining $2f+1$ correct acceptors will only vote for a single sequence, which means there are only enough correct processes to commit one of them. Note that the fact that proposals are sent as extensions to previous sequences is critical to the safety of the protocol. In particular, since the votes from acceptors can be reordered by the network before being delivered to the learners, if these values were single commands it would be impossible to guarantee that non-commutative commands would be learned in a total order. \par
\noindent {\bf Step 3: Acceptors to learners.} Phase $2b$ messages, which are sent from acceptors to learners, contain the current ballot number, the command sequence and the $N-f$ proofs gathered in the verification round. One could think that, since acceptors are already gathering proofs that a value will eventually be committed, learners are not required to gather $N-f$ votes and they can wait for a single phase $2b$ message and validate the $N-f$ proofs contained in it. However, this is not the case due to the possibility of learners learning sequences without the leader being aware of it. If we allowed the learners to learn after witnessing $N-f$ proofs for just one acceptor then that would raise the possibility of that acceptor not being present in the quorum of phase $1b$ messages. Therefore, the leader wouldn't be aware that some value was proven and learned. The only way to guarantee that at least one correct acceptor will relay the latest proven sequence to the leader is by forcing the learner to require $N-f$ phase $2b$ messages since only then will one correct acceptor be in the intersection of the two quorums. \par
\noindent {\bf Arbitrating an order after a conflict.} When, in a fast ballot, non-commutative commands are  concurrently proposed, these commands may be incorporated into the sequences of various acceptors in different orders, and therefore the sequences sent by the acceptors in phase $2b$ messages will not be equivalent and will not be learned. In this case, the leader subsequently runs a classic ballot and gathers these unlearned sequences in phase $1b$. Then, the leader will arbitrate a single serialization for every previously proposed command, which it will then send to the acceptors. Therefore, if non-commutative commands are concurrently proposed in a fast ballot, they will be included in the subsequent classic ballot and the learners will learn them in a total order, thus preserving consistency.\par
	\vspace*{-.4cm}
\subsection{Classic ballots} 

Classic ballots work in a way that is very close to the original Paxos protocol~\cite{Lam98}. Therefore, throughout our description, we will highlight the points where BGP departs from that original protocol, either due to the Byzantine fault model, or due to behaviors that are particular to the specification of Generalized Paxos.

In this part of the protocol, the leader continuously collects proposals by assembling all commands that are received from the proposers since the previous ballot in a sequence. (This differs from classic Paxos, where it suffices to keep a single proposed value that the leader attempts to reach agreement on). When the next ballot is triggered, the leader starts the first phase by sending phase $1a$ messages to all acceptors containing just the ballot number. Similarly to classic Paxos, acceptors reply with a phase $1b$ message to the leader, which reports all sequences of commands they voted for. In classic Paxos, acceptors also promise not to participate in lower-numbered ballots, in order to prevent safety violations~\cite{Lam98}.  However, in BGP this promise is already implicit, given (1) there is only one leader per view and it is the only process allowed to propose in a classic ballot and (2) acceptors replying to that message must be in the same view as that leader.\par
As previously mentioned, phase $1b$ messages contain $N-f$ proofs for each learned sequence. By waiting for $N-f$ of such messages, the leader is guaranteed that, for any learned sequence $s$, at least one of the messages will be from a correct acceptor that, due to the quorum intersection property, participated in the verification phase of $s$. In the CFT version of the protocol, the leader could determine if some value had been chosen by a majority of acceptors by looking for $f+1$ identical votes in the quorum of phase $1b$ messages. If some value had $f+1$ votes, no other value could have been chosen since there are only other $2f$ acceptors in the system. However, the same isn't true for BGP because $f+1$ identical votes for some value only attest that at least one correct process voted for that value. It's impossible to determine if some value was chosen by a majority unless the leader witnesses $2f+1$ identical votes. Note that, since each command is signed by the proposed (this signature and its check is not explicit in the pseudocode), a Byzantine acceptor can't relay made-up commands. However, it can omit commands from its phase $1b$ message, which is why it's necessary for the leader to be sure that at least one correct acceptor in its quorum took part in the verification quorum of any learned sequence. \par
After gathering a quorum of $N-f$ phase $1b$ messages, the leader initiates phase $2a$ where it assembles a proposal and sends it to the acceptors. This proposal sequence must be carefully constructed to ensure both progress and consistency. Due to the importance and required detail of the leader's value picking rule, it will be described next in its own section. The acceptors reply to phase $2a$ messages by broadcasting their verification messages containing the proposed sequence and proof of their committal to that sequence. After receiving $N-f$ verification messages, an acceptor sends its phase $2b$ message to the learners, containing the ballot, the proposal from the leader and the $N-f$ proofs gathered in the verification phase. The behavior and reasoning behinds the learners actions is the same as in fast ballots, so we omit it in this description.\par

\noindent {\bf Leader value picking rule.} Phase $2a$ is crucial for the correct functioning of the protocol because it requires the leader to pick a value that allows new commands to be learned, ensuring progress, while at the same time preserving a total order of non-commutative commands at different learners, ensuring consistency. The value picked by the leader is composed of three pieces: (1) the subsequence that has proven to be accepted by a majority of acceptors in the previous fast ballot, (2) the subsequence that has been proposed in the previous fast ballot but for which a quorum hasn't been gathered and (3) new proposals sent to the leader in the current classic ballot. \par
The first part of the sequence will be the largest sequence of the $N-f$ proven sequences sent in the phase $1b$ messages. The leader can pick such a value deterministically because, for any two proven sequences, they are either equivalent or one can be extended to the other. The leader is sure of this because for the quorums of any two proven sequences there is at least one correct acceptor that voted in both and votes from correct acceptors are always extensions of previous votes from the same ballot. If there are multiple sequences with the maximum size then they are equivalent (by same reasoning applied previously) and any can be picked. \par
The second part of the sequence is simply the concatenation of unproven sequences or commands in an arbitrary order. Since these commands are guaranteed to not be learned at any learner, they can be appended to the leader's sequence in any order. Since $N-f$ phase $2b$ messages are required for a learner to learn a sequence and the intersection between the leader's quorum and the quorum gathered by a learner for any sequence contains at least one correct acceptor, the leader can be sure that if a sequence of commands is unproven in all of the gathered phase $1b$ messages, then that sequence wasn't learned and can be safely appended to the leader's sequence in any order. \par 
The third part consists simply of commands sent by proposers to the leader with the intent of being learned at the current ballot. These values can be appended in any order and without any restriction since they're being proposed for the first time.
