% Abstract (Do not insert blank lines, i.e. \\) 
\abstract{One of the most recent members of the \emph{Paxos} family of protocols is \emph{Generalized} Paxos. This variant of Paxos has the characteristic that it departs from the original specification of consensus, allowing for a weaker safety condition where different processes can have a different views on a sequence being agreed upon. However, much like the original Paxos counterpart, Generalized Paxos does not have a simple implementation. Furthermore, with the recent practical adoption of Byzantine fault tolerant protocols in the context of blockchain protocols, it is timely and important to understand how Generalized Paxos can be implemented in the Byzantine model.	In this paper, we make two main contributions. First, we attempt to provide a simpler description of Generalized Paxos, based on a simpler specification and the pseudocode for a solution that can be readily implemented. Second, we extend the protocol to the Byzantine fault model, and provide the respective correctness proof.}
