#**European Illegal Parking**#
**European Illegal Parking** is a PyBossa application that uses crowdsourcing to identify badly parked vehicles in major European cities. This is a research project at [INESC-ID](https://www.inesc-id.pt) and [Instituto Superior TÃ©cnico, Universidade de Lisboa](https://tecnico.ulisboa.pt/en/)

## **Our goal** ##
The information you provide will help us collect enough data to build an European Illegal Parking Ranking. Hopefully, this ranking will raise awareness to the problem in Europe and thus pressure the national and local institutions to pursue more effective measures to tackle the problem.

## **How it works** ##
Based on Google Street View, we have gathered an extensive and detailed snapshot of the streets and other public spaces of a number of European cities, comprising thousands of photos. By analysing these photos, one by one, we can detect cases of illegal and dangerous parking and thus determine how frequent illegal parking is in each city. As a result, we will be able to point out which cities are success cases and which cities are clearly underperforming in tackling the problem.
