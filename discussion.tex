\subsection{Discussion}

The Byzantine Generalized Paxos protocol tackles two challenges in two different avenues of research, fault tolerance and relaxed consistency models. By specifying the generalized consensus problem, Generalized Paxos allows learners to learn concurrent proposals in different orders when the proposals commute. This idea can be related to models like causal consistency~\cite{bibid} and newer variable consistency models like RedBlue ~\cite{bibid} that attempt to decrease latency costs by reducing coordination requirements between replicas. Generalized Paxos reduces coordination requirements by allowing proposers to propose directly to the acceptors, reducing the number of communication steps to two. However, to preserve the consistency property, for $f$ classic faults and $e$ fast-learning faults, the total system size $N$ must uphold two conditions:
\begin{itemize}
	\item $N > 2f$
	\item $N > 2e+f$
\end{itemize} 
Additionally, the fast and classic quorums are, respectively, $N-e$ and $N-f$ which means there is a dependence relationship between these three concepts: number of tolerated faults, system size and quorum size. If we wish to keep $e$ small, then the fast ballot quorum will be a larger amount of the total system size which itself will be smaller. If we wish to allow fast ballots to progress in the presence of a higher number of faults, $e=f$ which means $N >3f$ and $N-e=N-f$. However, we intend to provide Byzantine fault tolerance which also requires a total system size of $N>3f$ and a quorum size of $2f+1$. Due to this observation, we manage to amortize the cost of both features by using a larger system size to achieve both at the cost of one. \par
\textbf{Optimizations} One possible optimization of the Byzantine Generalized Paxos protocol leverages universally commutative commands or sequences of commands, which we define as sequences which commute with any other. Universally commutative sequences allows us to reduce latency by decreasing the number of phase $2b$ messages required to learn to a smaller $f+1$ quorum. Since, by definition, these sequences are guaranteed to never produce conflicts, the $N-f$ quorum isn't required to prevent learners from learning conflicting sequences. Instead, a $f+1$ quorum is sufficient for the learner to be sure that the proposed sequence was proposed by a correct proposer.
