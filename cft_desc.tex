\textbf{Simplified Problem} Generalized Paxos solves the problem of agreeing on increasing sets of values. These sets of commands are defined to be \textit{c-structs}, which are structures more generic than sequences since they allow for command sequences $\sigma$ and $\tau$ to be equivalent despite having different contents. This is possible because there is a custom \textit{equivalence relation} between \textit{c-structs}. However, this generalization comes at the cost of increased complexity. To present a simpler version of the protocol, our simplification does away with the generic equivalence relation and defines it to be as the equivalence relation between command histories.  \par
