	abstract = {Spanner is Google's scalable, multi-version, globally- distributed, and synchronously-replicated database. It is the first system to distribute data at global scale and sup- port externally-consistent distributed transactions.

This API and its implementation are critical to supporting exter- nal consistency and a variety of powerful features: non- blocking reads in the past, lock-free read-only transac- tions, and atomic schema changes, across all of Spanner},

ZooKeeper implements a primary-backup scheme in which a primary process executes clients operations and uses Zab to propagate the corresponding incremental state changes to backup processes1. Due the dependence of an incremental state change on the sequence of changes previously generated, Zab must guarantee that if it delivers a given state change, then all other changes it depends upon must be delivered first. Since primaries may crash, Zab must satisfy this requirement despite crashes of primaries.},

VFT introduces the Visigoth model, which makes it possible to calibrate the timing assumptions of a system using a threshold of slow processes or messages, and also to distinguish between non-malicious arbitrary faults and correlated attack scenarios. This enables solutions that leverage the characteristics of data center systems, namely their secure environment and predictable performance, in order to allow replicated systems to be more efficient with respect to the utilization of resources than those designed under asynchrony and Byzantine assumptions, while avoiding the need to make a system synchronous, or to restrict failure modes to silent crashes. We implemented a VFT protocol for a state machine replication library, and ran several benchmarks. Our evaluation shows that VFT has comparable performance to existing schemes and brings significant benefits in terms of the throughput per dollar, i.e., the server cost for sustaining a certain level of request execution.},

abstract = {Reliable computer systems must handle malfunctioning components that give conflicting information to different parts of the system. This situation can be expressed abstractly in terms of a group of generals of the Byzantine army camped with their troops around an enemy city. Communicating only by messenger, the generals must agree upon a common battle plan. However, one of more of them may be traitors who will try to confuse the others. The problem is to find an algorithm to ensure that the loyal generals will reach agreement. It is shown that, using only oral messages, this problem is solvable if and only if more than two-thirds of the generals are loyal; so a single traitor can confound two loyal generals. With unforgeable written messages, the problem is solvable for any number of generals and possible traitors. Applications of the solutions to reliable computer systems are then discussed.},

The industry has so far addressed this problem by hardening crash-tolerant systems with ad hoc error detection checks, potentially overlooking critical fault scenarios. We propose a generic and principled hardening technique for Arbitrary State Corruption (ASC) faults, which specifically model the effects of realistic data corruptions on distributed processes. Hardening does not require the use of trusted components or the replication of the process over multiple physical servers. We implemented a wrapper library to transparently harden distributed processes. To exercise our library and evaluate our technique, we obtained ASC-tolerant versions of Paxos, of a subset of the ZooKeeper API, and of an eventually consistent storage by implementing crash-tolerant protocols and automatically hardening them using our library. Our evaluation shows that the throughput of our ASC-hardened state machine replication outperforms its Byzantine-tolerant counterpart by up to 70{\%}.},

@article{Dwork1988,
	abstract = {The concept of partial synchrony in a distributed system is introduced. Partial synchrony lies between the cases of a synchronous system and an asynchronous system. In a synchronous system, there is a known fixed upper bound {\&}Dgr; on the time required for a message to be sent from one processor to another and a known fixed upper bound {\&}PHgr; on the relative speeds of different processors. In an asynchronous system no fixed upper bounds {\&}Dgr; and {\&}PHgr; exist. In one version of partial synchrony, fixed bounds {\&}Dgr; and {\&}PHgr; exist, but they are not known a priori. The problem is to design protocols that work correctly in the partially synchronous system regardless of the actual values of the bounds {\&}Dgr; and {\&}PHgr;. In another version of partial synchrony, the bounds are known, but are only guaranteed to hold starting at some unknown time T , and protocols must be designed to work correctly regardless of when time T occurs. Fault-tolerant consensus protocols are given for various cases of partial synchrony and various fault models. Lower bounds that show in most cases that our protocols are optimal with respect to the number of faults tolerated are also given. Our consensus protocols for partially synchronous processors use new protocols for fault-tolerant “distributed clocks” that allow partially synchronous processors to reach some approximately common notion of time.},

In this paper we extend their work, identifying several critical system parameters, including various synchronicity conditions, and examine how varying these affects the number of faults which can be tolerated.

They allow replica contents to diverge in the short term to support concurrent work practices and tolerate failures in low-quality communication links. The importance of such techniques is increasing as collaboration through wide-area and mobile networks becomes popular. Optimistic replication deploys algorithms not seen in traditional “pessimistic” systems. Instead of synchronous replica coordination, an optimistic algorithm propagates changes in the background, discovers conflicts after they happen, and reaches agreement on the final contents incrementally. We explore the solution space for optimistic replication algorithms. This article identifies key challenges facing optimistic replication systems—ordering operations, detecting and resolving conflicts, propagating changes efficiently, and bounding replica divergence—and provides a comprehensive survey of techniques developed for addressing these challenges.

	abstract = {We describe PNUTS, a massively parallel and geographically distributed database system for Yahoo!'s web applications. PNUTS provides data storage organized as hashed or ordered tables, low latency for large numbers of concurrent requests including updates and queries, and novel per-record consistency guarantees. It is a hosted, centrally managed, and geographically distributed service, and utilizes automated load-balancing and failover to reduce operational complexity. The first version of the system is currently serving in production. We describe the motivation for PNUTS and the design and implementation of its table storage and replication layers, and then present experimental results.},

@article{Balegas2015,
	abstract = {Geo-replicated storage systems are at the core of current Internet services. The designers of the replication protocols used by these systems must choose between either supporting low-latency, eventually-consistent operations, or ensuring strong consistency to ease application correctness. We propose an alternative consistency model, Explicit Consistency, that strengthens eventual consistency with a guarantee to preserve specific invariants defined by the applications. Given these application-specific invariants, a system that supports Explicit Consistency identifies which operations would be unsafe under concurrent execution, and allows programmers to select either violation-avoidance or invariant-repair techniques. We show how to achieve the former, while allowing operations to complete locally in the common case, by relying on a reservation system that moves coordination off the critical path of operation execution. The latter, in turn, allows operations to execute without restriction, and restore invariants by applying a repair operation to the database state. We present the design and evaluation of Indigo, a middleware that provides Explicit Consistency on top of a causally-consistent data store. Indigo guarantees strong application invariants while providing similar latency to an eventually-consistent system in the common case.},
