This section argues for the correctness of the Byzantine Generalized Paxos protocol in terms of the specified consensus properties:\par

\textbf{Nontriviality} $learned_l$ can only contain proposed commands\par
\textbf{Proof} for a learner to learn a non-proposed command, either $2f+1$ or $\frac{3N+f+1}{4}$ acceptors would have to vote for it, depending on the type of ballot. However, only $f$ acceptors can manufacture votes for non-proposed command, which is insufficient for it to be learned. At most, in a classic ballot the leader can send a proposal that wasn't sent by any proposer but, since the leader is also a proposer (albeit a \textit{distinguished} proposer), nontriviality is preserved.\par

\textbf{Stability} If $learned_l = v$ then, at all later times, $v \sqsubseteq learned_l$, for any $l$ and $v$\par
\textbf{Proof} In a fast ballot, proposers can only propose increments to be appended to the learned command history and, therefore, learned sequences in fast ballots are always extensions of previous sequences. In classic ballots, for a learner to learn a sequence that isn't an extension of a previous learned sequence, at least $2f+1$ acceptors would have to vote for it and for that to happen the leader would have to propose it. The subsequent reasoning depends on whether the leader is faulty or not.\par
If the leader is Byzantine it can propose an invalid sequence. However, since the acceptors check if the last accepted sequence is a prefix of the proposal, it wouldn't reach $2f+1$ votes. In the situation where the leader tries to ignore commands accepted in the last ballot, at most $f$ faulty acceptors would vote for it due to maliciousness and another $f$ would vote for it because they didn't participate in the latest ballot, which wouldn't be enough to learn the sequence. \par
If the leader is not Byzantine, the acceptors could still report altered sequences when the leader attempts to read the state in \textit{phase 1/view-change}. For instance, $f$ faulty acceptors could maliciously report a sequence without the latest command and another $f$ could have not participated in the last ballot which only leaves a single acceptor that would report the latest correct sequence. This single correct value would be indistinguishable from an incorrect one. To prevent this, the leader signs proposals with his private key before sending them to acceptors. When a leader (possibly not the one that signed the last proposal) reds the state from the acceptors, he checks the signature to ensure that the sequence wasn't maliciously manufactured. At most, an acceptor could report an out-of-date but correct value. This means that $2f$ acceptors could report out-of-date sequence which still leaves one correct and updated sequence. Since the signatures assure us that this value isn't manufactured and the quorum intersection properties assure us that the acceptor participated in the latest ballot, the value must be correct and the leader can append his proposal to the value to which every other value is a prefix.
