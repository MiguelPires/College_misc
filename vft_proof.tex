\begin{theorem}At any time and for any two correct learners $l_i$ and $l_j$, $learned_{l_i}$ and $learned_{l_j}$ can subsequently be extended to equivalent sequences \par

\textbf{Proof:} \par

\indent\indent\indent\indent\parbox{\linewidth-\algorithmicindent*4}{\strut\textbf{Proof:} A sequence can be learned if: (1) the learner gathers either $N-s$ votes (Algorithm \ref{VFT-Learn} lines \{1-10\}), (2) the learner gathers $N-u$ votes after a timeout of $3T$ occurs and a verification quorum is gathered (Algorithm \ref{VFT-Learn} \{25-28,30-44\}) or (3) if the sequence is universally commutative  and the learner gathers $f+1$ votes (Algorithm \ref{VFT-Learn} \{19-23\}). The latter is encoded in the logical expression $s \bullet \sigma_1 \thicksim x \bullet \sigma_2$ which is true if the learned sequence can be extended with $\sigma_1$ to the same that any other sequence $x$ can be extended to with a possibly different sequence $\sigma_2$, therefore making it impossible to result in a conflict since the definition of conflicting sequences are sequences which cannot be extended to equivalent sequences.}

\indent\indent\indent\indent\indent\indent\parbox{\linewidth-\algorithmicindent*6}{\strut\textbf{Proof:} To prove that if any two sequences are accepted then they must be extensible to equivalent sequences, we must prove that two non-commutative sequences can't both gather a quorum of phase $2b$ messages to be learned. In order to gather for correct acceptors to send a phase $2b$ message for a sequence, they must gather $N-f$ verification messages  as shown in Algorithm \ref{VFT-Acc}, lines \{17-22\}. A correct acceptor will not send phase verification messages for two non-commutative sequences because it will only receive the commands in them once and therefore, only assemble them in one possible serialization (Algorithm \ref{VFT-Acc} lines \{10,14\}). Since we know that a correct acceptor will only send one phase verification message for one possibly non-commutative sequence, we must prove that, in any two gathered quorums, the intersection between them contains at least one correct process.\strut}
\indent\indent\indent\indent\indent\indent\parbox{\linewidth-\algorithmicindent*6}{\strut
Gathered quorums can be of size $Q_1=N-s$ or $N-u \leq Q_2 < N-s$, which means there are three possible combinations: (1) two quorums of size $Q_1$, (2) two quorums of size $Q_2$ and (3) one quorum of size $Q_1$ and one quorum of size $Q_2$.\par
To guarantee that two quorums of size $Q_1$ intersect in at least one correct process, it must hold that $N-s+N-s-N> o$. Assuming the worst case scenario where $N=u+o+s+1$:}
\indent\indent\indent\indent\indent\indent\parbox{\linewidth-\algorithmicindent*6}{
\begin{align*}
	N-s+N-s-N> o \\
	N-2s > o \\
	u+o+s+1-2s > o \\
	u+1-s>0 \\
	u+1>s 
\end{align*}}
\indent\indent\indent\indent\indent\indent\parbox{\linewidth-\algorithmicindent*6}{
Since we already assume that $u>s$, the condition holds.\par
Given two quorums with a size that is somewhere in the  interval $N-u \leq Q_2 < N-s$, when the first quorum is gathered the sizes are $q_1= N-u+a$ and $q_2=N-u+b$. The quantities $a$ and $b$ are such that $q_1$ and $q_2$ may be in some arbitrary position within the aforementioned interval. This means that there are $u-a-s$ crashed processes since, out of the maximum number of processes $u$ that can fail to participate in the quorum, $a$ did participate and $s$ did not but may be slow instead of faulty. Therefore, when these two quorums are assembled, we know that the system size is $N'=N-u+a+s$. To guarantee that the intersection between the quorums contains at least one correct process, the following must hold $q_1+q_2-N'>o$. }
\indent\indent\indent\indent\indent\indent\parbox{\linewidth-\algorithmicindent*6}{
\begin{align*}
	q_1+q_2-N'>o \\
	N-u+a+N-u+b-N+u-a-s>o \\
	N-u+b-s>o \\
	u+o+s+1-u+b-s>o\\
	b+1>0

\indent\indent\indent\indent\indent\indent\parbox{\linewidth-\algorithmicindent*6}{
Given a quorum of size $Q_1=N-s$ and a quorum of size $Q_2=N-u+a$, at least $u-a-s$ processes are faulty since, out of the maximum number of processes $u$ that can fail to participate in the quorum, $a$ did participate and $s$ did not but may be slow instead of faulty. This means that, when the quorums are gathered, the system's size is $N'=N-u+a+s$. To guarantee that the intersection between quorums contains at least one correct process, the following must hold $Q_1+Q_2-N'>o$: }

\indent\indent\indent\indent\indent\indent\parbox{\linewidth-\algorithmicindent*6}{\strut\textbf{Proof:}To prove that values accepted in different ballots are extensible to equivalent sequences, it suffices to prove that for any sequences $s$ and $s'$ accepted at ballots $b$ and $b'$, respectively, such that $b < b'$ then $s \sqsubseteq s'$. By Algorithm \ref{VFT-Acc} lines \{17-22\}, any correct acceptor only votes for its variable $val_a$ when it receives proofs for the same value from other $2f$ acceptors. Therefore, we prove that a $val_a$ that receives $2f+1$ verification messages, is always an extension of a previous $val_a$ that received $2f+1$ verification messages. By Algorithm \ref{VFT-Acc} lines \{35,46\}, $val_a$ only changes when a leader sends a proposal in a classic ballot or when an acceptor sends a sequence in a fast ballot.\par}
\indent\indent\indent\indent\indent\indent\parbox{\linewidth-\algorithmicindent*6}{
In the first case, $val_a$ is substituted by the leader's proposal which means we must prove it's an extension of any $val_a$ that previously obtained $2f+1$ verification votes. By Algorithm \ref{VFT-Lead} lines \{24-47\}, the leader's proposal is prefixed by the largest of the proven sequences (i.e., $val_a$ sequences that receives $2f+1$ votes) relayed by a quorum of acceptors in phase $1b$ messages. Note that, the verification in Algorithm \ref{VFT-Acc} line \{30\} prevents a Byzantine leader from sending a sequence that isn't an extension of previous proved sequences. If all the proven sequences are extensible to the same sequence then it's clear that the largest proven sequence is an extension of all the proven sequences relayed in phase $1b$ messages. However, since that is the same result we are trying to prove, we must use induction to do so. As our induction step, we assume that for some ballot $b$ and any two proven sequences $s$ and $s'$, the following is true $s \sqsubseteq s' \lor s' \sqsubseteq s$ (i.e., all sequences are extensible to the same sequence). In the next ballot $b'=b+1$, by picking the largest sequence as in Algorithm \ref{VFT-Lead} lines \{41-47\}, the leader will create a proposal that is an extension of any previously $val_a$ value that gathered $2f+1$ verification messages. Therefore, if all the proven sequences in some ballot $b$ are extensible to the same sequence, then every proven $val_a$ in subsequent ballots will be an extension of those values and, therefore, also an extensible to the same sequence.\strut}
\indent\indent\indent\indent\indent\indent\parbox{\linewidth-\algorithmicindent*6}{\strut
In the second case, a proposer's proposal $c$ is appended to $val_a$ which means that any acceptors new value $val_a'$ will be extensible to the same sequence as the previous $val_a$ since, by definition of the append operation, $c \bullet val_a \sqsubseteq val_a'$.\strut}
